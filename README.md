In this project, I have solved the FashionMNIST classification task using the basic building blocks provided by PyTorch. I utilized various PyTorch classes, such as the `Dataset` class, which assists with transformations, target transformations, and other data-related operations. I also used the `DataLoader` class to divide the dataset into batches with a fixed batch size. 

The `Dataset` class in PyTorch allows us to efficiently handle datasets by organizing them into batches, which improves the efficiency of training. Additionally, I have implemented custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the classification task. I leveraged PyTorch's class-based system to define custom CNNs and other Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models.
